## BDD
{Line of thought used to prepare the webApp:
The user inputs their date of Birth and the getDay functions takes in those arguements and outputs a number between 0 and 6 which refer to days of the week, i.e. from Sunday to Saturday
So if the result is a 5 it will point to Friday and 0 to Sunday and so on
the same result will be used to point to the Akan Names
depending on the Gender selected the the corresponding array will be used for Akan names}
